adults**

## Introduction

- Grip strength can be easily measured in a clinical setting when other functional measures such as gait speed may be limited due to specific health restrictions (e.g. assistive devices)

- Reduced grip strength has also been shown to be a marker of overall physiological function in elderly adults even in the presence of differences in physical condition, exercise habits, and history of injury. Decreased hand grip strength correlates with lower scores in several cognitive domains including executive function, attention, working memory, language and semantic categorization, and overall cognition in non-demented older adults

## Result

- For middle-aged individuals, grip strength was associated with the Stroop Interference (r = .471; p = .031 or p < .05) and COWAT scores (r = .458; p = .037 or p < .05) (Fig 1). Grip strength was not associated with other cognitive measures in middle-aged individuals. Further, no associations were found between cognitive measures and grip strength in the young individuals.

## Discussion

- this study showed that specific domains of cognition may be more sensitive to detection of early cognitive declines than global measures and that grip strength may serve as biomarker for detecting for early cognitive changes in middle-aged adults.
- The findings of this study further justify the inclusion of grip-based measures in future randomly selected, nationally representative longitudinal designs to establish a predictive relationship between cognitive performance and grip strength of middle-aged adults.

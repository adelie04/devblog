## Introduction

- According to the World Health Organization (WHO), the world population aged over 60 years will have doubled in number by 2050, with an estimated total of 2 billion people `WHO. Ageing and Health (WHO, 2018).`

---

## Result

- Statistically signifcant differences were observed for the diferent CMG (p<0.001) and within the CMG for the diferent age groups for Memory Sweep (p=0.013), Babble Bots (p<0.001) and Unique (p<0.001)

## Discussion

- Though the changes in diferent cognitive abilities over the lifespan are relatively well-documented22,23, there is less evidence on the plasticity of these diferent cognitive functions across the lifespan23–25. Furthermore, it has not yet been established whether all cognitive functions can be trained or the extent to which progress can be achieved in healthy subjects of diferent ages
